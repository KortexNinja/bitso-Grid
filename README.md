# bitso-Grid
A bot that buys and Sell bitcoin, eth, xrp, ltc or any cryptocurrency available for the Mexican Exchange Bitso using a Grid strategy using bitso API

## Bitso uses Python 2.7 

## Instructions

First install the bitso library using pip install bitso-py
Run the script

your gonna be asked for the grid size, the distance between buy orders, the distance between sell orders, the pair you want to trade i.e. 'xrp_mxn', 'btc_mxn', etc, and the quantity of currency you're going to buy/sell each time. 

### Important

It's recommended for you to have some currency in the pair, for example if you're trading mxn_btc I recommend you have both mxn and btc so you can buffer the movements, remember this is a high volatility market. If the market moves and you don't have enough btc to buy or sell when the order is executed, the bot will stop.

 The script ask you things in spanish right now only because the exchange is from MÃ©xico. I'll add english if asked.
